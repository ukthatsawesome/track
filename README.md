# Short Summary

- A simple system to track work from start to finish: create “batches,” add “bags” inside them, collect information with custom “forms,” and see “submissions” and “reports” to understand progress.

# What It Does

- Manages batches (groups of work) and bags (items in those batches).
- Lets you build forms and capture structured data for batches or bags.
- Keeps records safe: completed items are locked unless an admin changes them.
- Shows clear details and summaries, including quick reports (e.g., batches by country).
- Secure login with user accounts; works with a backend API you configure.

- Please read README.md in backend folder to set up the backend.
- Please read README.md in frontend folder to set up the frontend.
